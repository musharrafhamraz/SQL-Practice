# SQL and NoSQL Databases Overview

### **1. Key Differences Between SQL and NoSQL Databases**
- **SQL Databases:** Use structured query language (SQL), have predefined schemas, are table-based, and are best for complex queries and multi-row transactions.
- **NoSQL Databases:** Use dynamic schemas, store data as documents, key-value pairs, or graphs, and are ideal for unstructured data and scalability.

### **2. Define a Relational Database and How it Stores Data**
A relational database organizes data into tables (rows and columns) with relationships between them. Each row represents a record, and each column holds a specific type of data (attribute).

### **3. Benefits of Using an RDBMS Over a Flat File System**
- **Data Integrity:** Ensures accurate and consistent data.
- **Flexibility:** Allows easy querying and modification.
- **Security:** Provides access control and permissions.
- **Relationships:** Handles complex relationships between data efficiently.

### **4. Limitations of Relational Databases**
- Not ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., multimedia).
- Scaling is limited (requires vertical scaling).
- Complex queries can become slower with very large datasets.

### **5. Role of SQL in Managing Relational Databases**
SQL is used to interact with relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data, define schemas, and manage relationships and constraints in a structured and efficient manner.
